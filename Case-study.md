## Case Study: Cisco Edge Devices Exploitation (2025)

In 2025, a large-scale exploitation campaign targeted Cisco edge devices,
Including ASA, Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), IOS, and IOS XE platforms.
Attackers exploited multiple critical vulnerabilities that enabled
Remote code execution, authentication bypass, unauthorized configuration
Manipulation, and long-term persistence within enterprise networks.

These vulnerabilities allowed threat actors to gain deep access to
Network infrastructure, posing significant risks to confidentiality,
Integrity, and availability of critical systems.

This case study provides a comprehensive academic analysis of the Incident,
Examining vulnerability characteristics, attack vectors, operational impact,
And recommended mitigation strategies. The objective is to outline lessons
Learned and highlight best practices for securing modern network
Infrastructures.

## Mitigation and Defense

To reduce the risk of similar attacks, a Defense In Depth strategy
Should be implemented:

- Firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic
- Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
- Network segmentation to isolate critical assets
- Regular patch management and updates
- Strong authentication and access control
- Continuous monitoring and logging

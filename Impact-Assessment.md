# Impact Assessment

Edge devices constitute the primary point of ingress and egress in enterprise networks. Compromise grants attackers:
- Full administrative control
- Ability to monitor, redirect, or intercept traffic
- Alteration of AAA, ACL, WebVPN configs
- Persistent access via hidden accounts or VPN tunnels

**Organizational risk:** Complete internal network infiltration
